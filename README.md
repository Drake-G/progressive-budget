# Budget Tracker (PWA)

This is a budget tracker that will allow the user to track their incoming and outgoing funds, if they do so while offline, the browser will update when they come back online.

## Installation

This budget tracker is currently not deployed due to a Heroku conflict. My main issue with this assignment has been that, quite frankly, the syntax really confuses me and I'm just not quite sure how to impliment it properly. I've been trying to base it off of the mini project for this unit but I'm having a very hard time figuring out what goes where and why each component is the way it is...I'm sure I'm just confusing myself but I've spent a lot of time trying to get the right set up locally and I'm kinda lost, thus why this one is very far from working.
